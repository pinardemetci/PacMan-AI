# PacMan-AI
SofDes Spring'15 final project by Kelly Brennan, Stephanie Northway, and Pinar Demetci.
The project aims to use AI and machine learning strategies for pathfinding in PacMan. 

PROJECT PROPOSAL:
- Big Idea:  We aim to implement computer learning to strategize and win Pacman game. We’ll be exploring AI concepts to develop game strategies.
- MVP: 
    Plays pacman without the ghosts and implements pathfinding and a simple AI strategy to         consume food in the     shortest amount of time
- Stretched goals:
    Plays pacman well with ghosts
    Implement a neural network

Learning Goals:
Kelly - Getting more experience with object oriented programming; data processing; learn about machine learning; think about other applications of machine learning; gain more confidence coding and experience debugging; working with github efficiently 
Pinar - Learning about AI, machine learning and algorithms, practicing object-oriented programming, collaborative coding and using GitHub effectively.
Steph - Learning AI concepts, being a decent team member on a software project, writing good tests and documentation
Shared - Learning AI concepts, being good collaborators and teammates

Implementation Plan: Identified a library or framework that you think will be useful for you project. If you don’t have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information


The framework laid out in Berkeley’s CS188 class (http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) will provide us with sufficient scaffolding, including an implementation of the Pacman game in Python, to get started. There may even be a bit too much scaffolding in the course materials; we will discuss as a team how much of it we want to make use of. We will likely use the numpy and scipy libraries for the machine learning part of the project.

Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks roughly to finish the the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. This schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

Week 1: 
Start the Machine Learning and AI and Algorithms toolbox
Set up Github, install numpy/scipy
Go through the Berkely CS188 site to see what is available, decide what to use (Individual)

Week 2:  
Start the skeleton of the website.
First stab at architecture
Keeping track of Pacman location and begin AI in finding food
Design Review
Week 3: 
Have MVP
Code Review
UML diagram
Decide which advanced learning strategy we want to use
Work on website
Week 4: 
Working on advanced learning strategy
Continue website development
Week 5:
“Mid”-Project Presentation (4/23)
Continue website development
 Week 6: 
Finishing touches on code and website
Final poster and demo session (Wednesday, May 6th from 4pm - 7pm)

Collaboration Plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. May also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use. Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure. 
Have formal weekly meetings Sundays 3-5pm and informal meetings on Wednesdays 8-11pm when we can
Work on implementing specific parts of program between meetings
Pair programming during weekly meetings
Software development strategies
Pair programming during meetings
Good Git practices: feature branches and pull requests

Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of the this project?
AI/machine learning is hard! It may be a little much for us to implement a successful AI in 6 weeks. Also, relying on Berkeley’s code and having to go through and understand it could be a bottleneck. Leaving the website development into the end. Senioritis.

Additional Course Content: Covering more AI and machine learning related concepts -additional to the toolboxes- would be useful. Coding/data processing efficiency
